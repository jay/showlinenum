#
# This gawk script changes the output of git diff to prepend the line number for each line.
#
#
#### Usage:
#
# git diff [options] | showlinenum.awk [options]
#
# All options for showlinenum require a value and are specified using the format option=value.
#
####
#
#
#### Output:
#
# The diff line output is in this format:
# [path:]<line number>:<diff line>
#
# When the path is shown it's the new version's file path. Line numbers are shown for lines in the
# new version of the file (ie lines that are the same or added). If a line appears only in the old
# version of the file (ie lines removed) or the warning indicator is found then padding space is
# used in place of a line number. If a file was removed a tilde ~ is used in place of a line number.
#
# The first character in <diff line> is one of four indicators:
# - : Line removed
# + : Line added
# <space> : Line same
# \ : diff warning about previous line
#
# For example:
#  :-removed
# 7:+added
# 8: common
#  :\ No newline at end of file
#
# As far as I know the backslash indicator is only used for the missing newline at EOF warning. When
# that warning appears it applies to the line immediately above it. In the example above both the
# old and new version of the compared file are missing the newline at EOF. If the line above a
# warning is a removed line then the warning applies to the old version of the file, and if the line
# above a warning is an added line then the warning applies to the new version of the file.
#
# On error a line that starts with ERROR: and is followed by script name and error message(s)
# --which may be one or more lines-- is sent to standard error output (stderr). The script then
# continues to the next line. This is unimplemented for now. All errors are treated as fatal errors.
#
# On fatal error a line that starts with FATAL: and is followed by script name and error message(s)
# --which may be one or more lines-- is sent to standard error output (stderr). The script then
# aborts with exit code 1.
#
####
#
#
#### Examples:
#
# Simple example. Line numbers are prepended to git diff's output.
# git diff --cached | showlinenum.awk
#
# This script properly handles the ANSI escape color codes output by git diff. To get color output
# you have to force git diff to send it by passing --color=always. When that option is used the
# color output is always output so it is not recommended unless you are either outputting to the
# terminal or somewhere that can properly handle the color codes. Many scripts do not function
# correctly when working with color coded input.
#
# This is the same as the first example, but with color output.
# git diff --color=always --cached | showlinenum.awk
#
# Options can be passed to this script by using awk's -v option or the traditional way (shown).
# git diff --color=always HEAD~1 HEAD | showlinenum.awk show_header=0
# git diff --color=always HEAD~1 HEAD | showlinenum.awk show_path=1 show_hunk=0
#
####
#
#
#### Options:
#
# @show_header [0,1] default: 1
# Show diff headers.
#
# Example:
# diff --git a/abc.c b/abc.c
# index 285065f..2471f87 100644
# --- a/abc.c
# +++ b/abc.c
#
##
#
# @show_hunk [0,1] default: ( show_header ? 1 : 0 )
# Show line hunks.
#
# Example: @@ -0,0 +1,17 @@
#
##
#
# @show_path [0,1] default: ( show_header ? 0 : 1 )
# Show paths before line numbers.
#
# Example:
# testdir/file:39:+some added text
#
##
#
# @show_binary [0,1] default: ( show_path ? 1 : 0 )
# Show a binary file that differs in an empty format. [path:][~]:
#
# Binary files have no concept of lines, therefore there is no line number or diff line to show
# that a binary file differs. If the headers are shown you can always see whether or not a binary
# file differs because there will be a message "Binary files <old> and <new> differ". If the headers
# are not shown however, that message is suppressed and a binary file that differs has an "empty
# format" with no information, except for a tilde that will be shown if the file was removed.
#
# Here are two examples of the empty format, one where the path is shown and one where it isn't:
# testdir/binary_file::
# :
#
# Here is an example of a removed binary file, path shown:
# calc.exe:~:
#
##
#
# @allow_colons_in_path [0,1] default: 0
# Allow colons in path.
#
# By default this script will abort if it encounters a path that contains a colon. That's done to
# guarantee that this script's diff line output can always be parsed with the first colon occurring
# immediately after the full path, if the path is shown. Even if it's not shown it's still checked.
